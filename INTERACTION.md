Electron Ionisation:Electron ionization describted as electron impact ionization and electron bombardment ionization. It is an ionization method in which energetic electrons interact with solid or gas phase atoms or molecules to produce ions. This technique is considered a hard ionization method, since it uses highly energetic electrons to produce ions.

Ionic Ionisation: Ionic ionisation, is the process by which an atom or a molecule acquires a negative or positive charge by gaining or losing electrons, often in conjunction with other chemical changes. The resulting electrically charged atom or molecule is called an ion. Ionization can result from the loss of an electron after collisions with subatomic particles collisions with other atoms, molecules and ions, or through the interaction with electromagnetic radiation.

Compton Scattering: Compton scattering, is the scattering of a photon by a charged particle, usually an electron. It results in a decrease in energy (increase in wavelength) of the photon (which may be an X-ray or gamma ray photon), called the Compton effect. Part of the energy of the photon is transferred to the recoiling electron. Inverse Compton scattering occurs when a charged particle transfers part of its energy to a photon.
